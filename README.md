# ECE 3301 - Introduction to Microcontrollers
Microcontroller programming, applications, and interfacing.

## Part 1
For the first part of the course, we worked with Assembly for this archaic chip I fucking despised. Not because of the chip by itself, but because we were forced to code in Assembly FOR THAT SPECIFIC CHIP! If it was at least assembly x86 it would be OK, but not for this PIC chip. F***

## Part 2
Joy, happiness, what else to say. Now we were actually doing something that could be translated to "industry" as we stopped using assembly for that old-ass chip and did some basic embedded programming in C. NOW WE WERE TALKING

## Notes
- Please, if you seeing this, disregard the CHAOS of the code. I literally rushed every class to get it done and get out of there as I wanted to go home. I might or might not pass the code through GPT to make it look nice and clear.
- The project was divided in 2 sections, electrical and computer (coding). I did the coding part while my friend and partner Brandon Contreras did the electical part (wiring).
